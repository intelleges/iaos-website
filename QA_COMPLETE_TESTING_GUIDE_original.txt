Download System Rules
3-Document Lifetime Limit

Rule: Each unique email address can download a maximum of 3 documents across their
lifetime.

Counting Logic

• What counts: Any document downloaded via EmailCaptureModal
• What doesn't count: Case studies (require Calendly, not tracked in

documentDownloads table)
• Scope: Lifetime (not per day, not per session)
• Tracking: documentDownloads table in database

Database Schema
SQL

documentDownloads (
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
email VARCHAR(320) NOT NULL,
name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
company VARCHAR(255),
documentTitle VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
documentUrl TEXT NOT NULL,
documentType ENUM('capability', 'protocol', 'whitepaper'),
downloadedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
followUpEmailSent TINYINT DEFAULT 0,

followUpEmailSentAt TIMESTAMP NULL
)

API Endpoints
1. Check Limit
TypeScript

documentDownloads.checkLimit({ email: string })
// Returns: { email, downloadCount, limitReached, remainingDownloads }

2. Record Download
TypeScript

documentDownloads.recordDownload({
email: string,
name: string,
company?: string,
documentTitle: string,
documentUrl: string,
documentType: 'capability' | 'protocol' | 'whitepaper'
})
// Returns: { success, downloadCount, remainingDownloads }

Testing Scenarios
Scenario 1: First Download (0/3 used)

1. User enters email: test@example.com
2. Submit form
3. Expected: Download succeeds, count = 1, remaining = 2

Scenario 2: Second Download (1/3 used)

1. Same email: test@example.com
2. Submit form
3. Expected: Download succeeds, count = 2, remaining = 1

Scenario 3: Third Download (2/3 used)
1. Same email: test@example.com

2. Submit form
3. Expected: Download succeeds, count = 3, remaining = 0

Scenario 4: Fourth Download (3/3 used - LIMIT REACHED)
1. Same email: test@example.com
2. Submit form
3. Expected:
• EmailCaptureModal closes immediately
• DownloadLimitReachedModal opens
• NO download occurs
• NO database record created

DownloadLimitReachedModal

Content:
• Icon: Checkmark in blue circle
• Title: "You've Reached Your Download Limit"
• Message: "You've downloaded 3 free resources. To access more compliance documents
and get personalized guidance, schedule a brief call with our team."
• CTA Button: "Schedule a Meeting" → Opens Calendly in new tab
• Secondary action: Close modal (X button or click outside)
Calendly URL:
Plain Text

https://calendly.com/intelleges/demo

Email Automation Workflows
2-Hour Delayed Follow-Up Email

Trigger: User successfully downloads a document via EmailCaptureModal
Process:
1. User submits EmailCaptureModal form

2. Backend records download in documentDownloads table
3. Backend creates scheduled email in scheduledEmails table
• scheduledFor = current time + 2 hours
• sent = 0 (not sent yet )
4. Background processor (cron job) runs every hour
5. Processor finds emails where scheduledFor <= NOW() and sent = 0
6. Processor sends email via SendGrid
7. Processor marks sent = 1 and sets sentAt timestamp

Edge Cases & Error Handling
Download System Edge Cases
Scenario
User clears cookies between downloads
User uses different capitalization
(Test@example.com vs test@example.com)
User enters invalid email format
Database connection fails
S3 CDN URL is invalid
User clicks Download button multiple times
rapidly

Email Automation Edge Cases

cookies)
Treated as same email (normalized to
lowercase)
Form validation prevents submission
Error toast: "An error occurred. Please try
again."
Browser shows download error, but download
is still recorded
Button disabled after first click, prevents
duplicate records

Scenario
Cron job doesn't run for 3 hours
SendGrid API rate limit exceeded
User's email bounces
User downloads 3 documents in 5 minutes

Expected Behavior
All pending emails sent on next cron run
Email marked as failed, retry on next cron run
Marked as failed in database, no retry
3 separate emails scheduled, sent 2 hours after
each download

Modal Edge Cases
Scenario
User opens modal, navigates away, comes
back
User opens modal on mobile
User has JavaScript disabled

Expected Behavior
Modal state resets (no persisted form data)
Modal is responsive, full-width on small screens
Modals don't work (graceful degradation not
implemented)

downloads
3. Case Study Downloads: Not tracked in download limit system (requires Calendly)
4. Email Processor: Requires manual cron job setup (not automatic)
5. SEO Component: Missing from some pages (Pricing, Resources)
